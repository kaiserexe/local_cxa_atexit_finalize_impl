## üìñ Overview

The "local_cxa_atexit_finalize_impl" repository provides a solution for C++ developers working with Zygisk modules. It offers a local implementation of `__cxa_atexit` and `__cxa_finalize`. This helps prevent interference with the global destructor management in C++. By using this implementation, global variable destructors are still called correctly without leaving gaps in the management array.

### üìú Background

In the Itanium C++ ABI, global destructors are managed with `__cxa_atexit` and called through `__cxa_finalize`. These are usually provided by libc, but they can leave gaps in the AtexitEntry array where destructors reside. This can lead to issues for Zygisk modules. Our implementation mimics existing solutions while ensuring smooth operation for your modules.

## üöÄ Features

- **Local Implementation:** Avoids conflicts with libc by providing a tailored solution.
- **Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with Zygisk modules and their requirements.
- **Detailed Documentation:** In-depth usage instructions help simplify integration.
- **Inspired by Bionic:** Built on proven techniques, modified for better function.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### What is `__cxa_atexit`?

`__cxa_atexit` is a function that allows C++ programs to register destructors for global variables. It ensures that these destructors are called when the program exits or when a dynamic library is unloaded.

### Why do I need this implementation?

This local implementation helps manage global destructors smoothly alongside Zygisk modules. It avoids potential conflicts that can arise when using the default libc implementation.

### Are there any known issues?

Currently, there are no major known issues with this implementation. However, as with any software, ensure your modules are thoroughly tested to prevent unexpected behavior.
