## üìñ Overview

The "local_cxa_atexit_finalize_impl" repository provides a solution for C++ developers working with Zygisk modules. It offers a local implementation of `__cxa_atexit` and `__cxa_finalize`. This helps prevent interference with the global destructor management in C++. By using this implementation, global variable destructors are still called correctly without leaving gaps in the management array.

### üìú Background

In the Itanium C++ ABI, global destructors are managed with `__cxa_atexit` and called through `__cxa_finalize`. These are usually provided by libc, but they can leave gaps in the AtexitEntry array where destructors reside. This can lead to issues for Zygisk modules. Our implementation mimics existing solutions while ensuring smooth operation for your modules.

## üöÄ Features

- **Local Implementation:** Avoids conflicts with libc by providing a tailored solution.
- **Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with Zygisk modules and their requirements.
- **Detailed Documentation:** In-depth usage instructions help simplify integration.
- **Inspired by Bionic:** Built on proven techniques, modified for better function.

4. **Extract the Files:** If the download is in a zip or tar format, extract the contents to a folder of your choice.

5. **Integrate into Your Module:**
   - Add `atexit.cpp` to your Zygisk module's source code set.
   - Make sure to link it correctly in your build setup.

### üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Compatible with Android environments using Zygisk.
- **C++ Compiler:** A recent version of a C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.
- **Zygisk:** This implementation is specifically designed to work with Zygisk. Ensure your setup supports it.

## üìå Usage Instructions

1. **Adding to Your Project:**
   - Copy the `atexit.cpp` file into your Zygisk module source folder.
   
2. **Modify the Build Files:** 
   - Ensure your build files (like `Android.mk` or `CMakeLists.txt`) include `atexit.cpp` to compile properly.

3. **Compile Your Module:** Run the building commands specific to your development environment. 

4. **Testing:**
   - After building, test your module thoroughly to ensure clean handling of destructors.

5. **Deploy:**
   - Following successful tests, deploy the module to your device through your usual method.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### What is `__cxa_atexit`?

`__cxa_atexit` is a function that allows C++ programs to register destructors for global variables. It ensures that these destructors are called when the program exits or when a dynamic library is unloaded.

### Why do I need this implementation?

This local implementation helps manage global destructors smoothly alongside Zygisk modules. It avoids potential conflicts that can arise when using the default libc implementation.

### Are there any known issues?

Currently, there are no major known issues with this implementation. However, as with any software, ensure your modules are thoroughly tested to prevent unexpected behavior.
